## my dotfiles

i have nothing to put in this readme just a small list of the CLI apps i like a lot. all programs listed below are in home/.local

* [lyrics-in-terminal](https://github.com/Jugran/lyrics-in-terminal/) - hooked into MPD because my player (strawberry) doesn't seem to be supported, this seems to work fine. excellent little tool for quickly getting the lyrics of what's currently playing.
* [epy](https://github.com/wustho/epy) - terminal EPUB reader. good for when i quickly need to check an ebook's validity before tagging with calibre and uploading to my server.

bonus mentions even though they're not in the repo for reasons:

* [movie](https://github.com/mayankchd/movie) - handy for searching any movie and getting data on it, especially useful for media server management.
* [doing](https://github.com/ttscoff/doing) - task management. yet another to-do kinda thing i'm trying to use to sort myself out
