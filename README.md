i usually use the catppuccin (specifically frappe, sometimes latte) themes wherever possible. i like cute things.

here's some CLI apps i like a lot
- [min](https://github.com/a-h/min) - gemini browser
- [lyrics-in-terminal](https://github.com/Jugran/lyrics-in-terminal/) - well, yeah
- [epy](https://github.com/wustho/epy) - epub reader
- [movie](https://github.com/mayankchd/movie) - quick movie info, good for plex/jellyfin
- [doing](https://github.com/ttscoff/doing) - task management / to-do list
- [mklicense](https://github.com/cezaraugusto/mklicense) - generate open source license with customized details (as prompted)
- [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) - finally stop using nano fucking loser
- [asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema) - record terminal
- [mdlt](https://github.com/metadelta/mdlt) - do math in terminal
- [ddgr](https://github.com/jarun/ddgr) - duckduckgo search
- [gdown](https://github.com/wkentaro/gdown) - google drive CLI downloader, bypasses google things that curl/wget sometimes can't
- [idea](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/idea) - jotting down quick ideas and listing them in a table
- [arttime](https://github.com/poetaman/arttime) - timer/clock with gorgeous ASCII art that you can add to. i added newjeans ASCII art. it's incredible.
- [taskbook](https://github.com/klaudiosinani/taskbook) - to-do list and task management
- [pastel](https://github.com/sharkdp/pastel/) & [xcolor](https://soft.github.io/xcolor/) - just for the screen color picking functionality. i could use xcolor on its own but pastel gives a neat graphic for the color and the RGB and HSL values along with the hex code. i aliased this to "pick"
