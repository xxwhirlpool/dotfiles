# laptop conky widget

this widget is adapted from an existing widget on github, [now clocking](https://github.com/foxfirecodes/now-clocking), but with both widgets displayed at once using two systemd services (provided in this directory), and the music widget backend swapped to a custom script that leverages the lastFM API.
